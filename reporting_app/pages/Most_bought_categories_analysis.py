        We will look at the two most bought in Sep 2023 categories in Amazon UK as noted in previous pages, 
        due to how similar are these two categories in rating and price. 
        Throughout this, we will see the similarity in the distribution of products metrics

        We can notice how only a small amount of products were bought more than 1000 times each in Sep. 2023,
        and as the amount bought increase, the number of products that has that much bought decrease quickly.
        Based on this, we decided to consider two different groups, those with more than 1000 products (moreBought = True, contribute 13%),
        and 1000 or less. We will look into the price and stars distribution of these two groups:

        One thing that we can notice is how the products that are bought more often have slightly lower prices than other,

        We can test this hypothesis to see if in average product with more people bought has lower prices:

        Based on the result of the test and the confidence interval of the difference between 2 groups, 
        we can see that the products with 1000 or more times bought are only about 2-3 dollars lower.
        Another factor that also make one product to be separate with other is how its wording in the title is different from other.
        And the next word clouds will show how most often words only in more selling product versus less selling product.

        there are some notables words that are most seen among titles of less bought products like: vape, vibrator, accessories, etc.,

        This makes it even more curious to look at if this minority group of sought after product looks like.

        In addition to this, as naming of a product is also important,
