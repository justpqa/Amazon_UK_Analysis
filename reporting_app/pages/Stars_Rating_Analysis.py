        As expected, the average amount of products bought in categories with higher average rating would be higher,

        while majority of categories with at least 4 stars average rating has less than 200 products per product in average,

        Contrary to the previous graph, we can see here how categories with lower average star ratings often have a higher price,

        When we look at the categories with higher star ratings, we can see how they are consistant in the categories' average price,

        We can easily notice how categories with higher rating would lead to slightly higher proportion of products with Best Selling Tag.
        However, we also need to notice how the variance also increase greatly as well, with the only exception being the group of 3-4 stars. 
        This might also affected by the fact that the many high rating categories could have different popularity that contribute to their Best Selling status,
        versus the products with lower star ratings are often bad products that will definitely not become Best Selling. 
        However it's still surprise to see low stars categories with decent rate of products with Best Selling Tag like Material Handling Product (0.8 average Stars Rating, but 1 out of 40 products has Best Selling Tag).
